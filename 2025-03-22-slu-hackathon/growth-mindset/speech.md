# Growth Mindset

## Introduction

Hey everyone. My name is Ian Howell and I'm a software engineer working for
Microsoft. I have 8 years of experience in the industry, working on both
proprietary software as well as open source projects, and recently have been
working to help build up our technical community in St. Louis, through various
meetups such as Code & Coffee and StlGo.

Today I'm going to spend some time talking about the Growth Mindset, and how it
can help you to break into the software development industry.

Before I get started with the talk, I would just like to extend a thank you to
everyone here who is involved with HackSLU; the organizers, the mentors, the
judges, the speakers, and of course, the competitors, without you guys this
event wouldn't be happening, and I *really* enjoy seeing these sorts of events
happening in St. Louis.

## A Growth Mindset

So what am I talking about? What is this "Growth Mindset" thing?

A person with a growth mindset believes that they are able to change themselves,
that they are a dynamic being. They know that they can improve their skills and
adapt to new situations, but they're also aware that it requires effort and
practice.

Twice a year, I do a self-assessment at work. At the top of our assessment tool,
there's this really cool quote:

    A growth mindset leads to a desire to learn and therefore a tendency to
    embrace challenges, to persist in the face of setbacks, to see failure as
    essential to mastery, and to learn from criticism.

This is what I reference twice a year to evaluate myself as an employee at
Microsoft. But more importantly, it's what I use to judge the progress that I
have made as a software developer and as a person in general. And it's not just
me. My coworkers also use it. My managers use it, not only to assess themselves,
but also as a guideline for how they determine which of their direct reports are
exceeding expectations, who they are going to promote, and who's going to be
getting a really big bonus. These are also the qualities that interviewers are
looking for when deciding who to bring on as a new hire or intern.

So it's really important to me. And it's really important to my company. And
honestly, it's probably pretty important to all of the companies that you want
to work for. So it should be really important to you too. A growth mindset will
help you to excel in all aspects of your life. It can help you become a better
developer, a better student, a better friend. Now, we're going to talk about
using it to break into the software development industry.

If you missed the quote, that's okay, we're going to break it down and discuss
each of the qualities, starting with:

## A Desire to Learn

A Growth Mindset leads to a desire to learn.

(intro pause)

About a year and a half ago, my team brought on a new Principal. For those who
don't know, a Principal is a step above Senior. So you would expect these guys
to know their stuff, to be experts in software, and to have answers to every
question. But this guy *didn't* have all the answers. In fact, he made it *very*
clear that he didn't have all the answers. I would hop on a call with him, and
it wouldn't matter if it was a one on one, a stand up with 10 or so people, or
an organization-wide meeting with more than 100 people on the call, this guy had
questions. And you would expect that these would be hard, technical questions.
The kinds of questions that a Principal would be expected to know the answer to.
But They weren't. They were **fundamental** questions, really *basic* questions.
Questions that every single person on the call should know the answer to. Quite
frankly, they were questions that I would have been embarrassed ask.

(brief pause)

But I started to notice something strange. Sometimes, he would ask a question,
and I would immediately get that gut feeling that this was really basic, that he
should really know this. But then I would notice something really humbling; I
sometimes didn't know the answer to the question either. I was learning just by
being in the same room as him. The whole team was learning and growing alongside
him.

(brief pause)

And this principal *excelled*. He uncovered problems that had existed on our
team since it was *formed*. He completely revamped our developer environments
into something that is much more user-friendly and easy to use. He refactored
large chunks of some of the most confusing code in our codebase. And ultimately,
he wound up fulfilling the role of a Principal, leading the way on large complex
features, from design to helping the rest of the team implement it.

In just a few months, this person went from being a "question asker" to being a
"question answerer". And he was able to do it because he had a *genuine
curiosity*.

(super brief pause)

He had a "Desire to Learn".

## A Tendency to Embrace Challenges

Raise your hand if you've been to a hackathon before. (pause for hands to go up)

If you've never been to a hackathon, I don't mean to scare you, but this is
going to be hard. It's going to be a challenge. You're going to have to learn a
lot of new technologies: new databases, new languages, new libraries,
frameworks, and APIs. And it's not going to stop at tech. You might be working
with new people, people who have different ideas than you, different
backgrounds. This is an all-night event. You're going to be up late tonight,
banging your head against your code. And tomorrow, the judges are going to come
around, and you'll have to present your idea, to convince them of its value and
feasibility. And yea, it's probably going to feel awkward.

But here's the thing: embracing these challenges is what will set you apart.
Each obstacle you face is an opportunity to learn and grow. Each new language
and database will be another tool in your toolbox. When you encounter a bug that
seems impossible to fix, look it as a chance to deepen your understanding. When
you work with someone whose perspective is different from yours, view it as an
opportunity to broaden your horizons.

Software is a moving target. In this industry, challenges are the name of the
game. Whether it's debugging a stubborn piece of code, learning a new
programming language, or collaborating with a diverse team, each challenge is a
chance to enhance your skills and expand your knowledge.

Raise your hand if you've ever been in an interview.

The process of landing a job in the software industry can be daunting. You'll
face technical interviews that test your problem-solving skills, coding
challenges that push your limits, and behavioral interviews that assess your
ability to work in a team. Every interview is a challenge, but it's also an
opportunity to showcase your growth mindset. You need to approach interviews
with the same enthusiasm and determination you bring to this hackathon. Don't
forget that interviews are a 2-way street; they provide you an opportunity to
feel out the company. Even if you don't get the job, every interview is a chance
to learn and grow and get closer to your goal.

So, as you dive into your projects this weekend, remember that every bug you
encounter, every roadblock you hit, is an opportunity. Embrace these challenges
with enthusiasm.

## Persistence in the Face of Setbacks and Failing your way to Mastery

An individual with a growth mindset "Persists in the Face of Setbacks", and
recognizes that "Failure is Essential to Mastery".

(intro pause)

Has anyone here ever heard of the "10,000 Hour Rule"?

The "10,000 Hour Rule" is a theory that it takes 10,000 hours of practice to
become an expert in a given skill.

(somewhat pregnant pause)

Okay, has anyone here ever played Dark Souls?

Dark Souls is a video game that is notorious for being *hard*. The gameplay loop
involves running from the start point to the boss, at which point you will
likely take a beating, fail, and having to start all over. And you will fail. A
lot. Perhaps for hours, although hopefully fewer than 10,000 :D.

Dark Souls is honestly a really good example of failing your way to mastery. The
first time you enter a boss arena, you're probably gonna get squashed flat in a
matter of seconds. But in time, you'll begin to learn the patterns and timings.
You'll find that you're able to hang in there just a bit longer on each attempt,
and whittle down the health bar just a tiny bit more. And with some effort, it
will being to feel less and less like a beat-down, and more like a dance. The
motions will ingrain themselves into your muscle memory. You'll start playing on
autopilot, and eventually, you'll emerge victoriously, able to progress to the
next level.

Obviously, this idea can be applied to any skill. You can apply it to
programming. You can apply it to interviewing. You can apply it to public
speaking, kinda like I'm doing right now.

And here's the thing. If you're going to fail, you might as well do it in a safe
environment where you are able to learn from your mistakes. It's part of the
reason why community events like HackSLU are so important. It provides you with
a safe environment where you can take risks, you can experiment, and you can
fail, knowing that there is a safety net there to catch you.

So don't be afraid to fail. Embrace it. Learn from it. And when you do fail,
don't let it get you down. Use it as an opportunity to grow and improve. It's
important to remember that failure is not the end of the world. It's just a step
on the road to mastery.

## Learning from Criticism

Criticism can be tough to hear, especially when you've poured your heart into a
project. But it's important to remember that feedback is a powerful tool for
growth. In the software industry, receiving constructive criticism is part of
the journey. Whether it's advice from a mentor, or comments from users, each
piece of criticism is an opportunity to improve.

One of the most common forms of feedback you'll encounter in the software
industry is the code review. Code reviews are an essential part of the
development process. They involve peers examining your code to identify bugs,
suggest improvements, and ensure that best practices are followed. While it can
be intimidating to have your work scrutinized, it's important to see code
reviews as a learning opportunity. Each comment and suggestion is a chance to
refine your coding skills, learn new techniques, and produce higher-quality
code. Embrace this process with an open mind, and you'll find yourself growing
as a developer.

At this hackathon, you'll be presenting your projects to judges. You can think
of this as a giant code review. Some of their responses might be positive, but
some of it might be critical. It's natural to feel defensive or discouraged, but
I hope that you will approach this criticism with an open mind. Instead of
seeing it as a personal attack, view it as valuable input that can help you
refine your skills and enhance your project.

Think about it this way: every piece of criticism is a chance to learn something
new. Maybe a judge points out a flaw in your code that you hadn't noticed. This
is an opportunity to improve your coding practices. Perhaps they suggest a
different approach to solving a problem. This is a chance to expand your
problem-solving toolkit, and change the way that you think about things.

The ability to learn from criticism is essential. It helps you grow as a
developer and ensures that your work continues to improve. When you receive
feedback, take a moment to reflect on it. Ask yourself how you can use this
information to become better. Seek clarification if needed, and don't be afraid
to ask for specific examples or suggestions.

Remember that the goal of criticism is not to tear you down but to build you up.
It's meant to help you reach your full potential. By embracing feedback and
using it to guide your growth, you'll become a more resilient and skilled
developer.

So, as you present your projects and receive feedback, keep an open mind. Listen
carefully, reflect on the criticism, and use it as a stepping stone to
improvement. This mindset will not only help you succeed in this hackathon but
will also prepare you for a successful career in the software industry. Learning
from criticism is a vital part of a growth mindset. Embrace it, learn from it,
and watch yourself grow.

And real quick before I conclude, I want to make a request. I am *not* a public
speaker; I don't normally do this kind of thing. So I'm asking you for feedback.
I will be around for most of this hackathon, and I would really love it if you
came up to me and let me know what you thought of this talk. What parts did you
like? Which ones did you hate? What could I have done better?

## Conclusion

A growth mindset is a powerful approach to life that can propel you to new
heights. A strong desire to learn will keep you on the path to achieving your
goals. Embracing challenges will keep your skills sharp and prepare you for the
ever-changing landscape of the software industry. Persisting in the face of
setbacks will keep you motivated, and help you recognize that failure is a part
of the learning process. And seeking out criticism will refine your abilities
and supercharge your growth.

Remember, this hackathon is just the beginning. The skills you develop, the
lessons you learn, and the mindset you cultivate here will serve you well
throughout your career. Embrace every challenge, and never stop learning.

The future of technology is in your hands, and with the right mindset, there's
no limit to what you can achieve. So, let's get out there, give it your all, and
make the most of this awesome opportunity.

Thank you, and best of luck with your projects!
