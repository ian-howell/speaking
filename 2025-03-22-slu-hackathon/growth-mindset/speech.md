# Growth Mindset

## Introduction

Hey everyone. My name is Ian Howell and I'm a software engineer working for
Microsoft. Before I get started with the talk, I would just like to extend a
thank you to everyone here who is involved with HackSLU; the organizers, the
mentors, the judges, the speakers, and of course, those of you who are
participating.

Today I'm going to spend some time talking about the Growth Mindset. This talk
is going to focus specifically on the value of a Growth Mindset with respect to
breaking into the software development industry, but I can't stress enough how
valuable it can be in all aspects of your life.

## A Growth Mindset

So what am I talking about? What is this "Growth Mindset" thing?

A person with a growth mindset believes that they are a dynamic being, capable
of improving their skills and adapting to new situations. They recognize that
effort and practice are essential to learning.

    A growth mindset leads to a desire to learn and therefore a tendency to
    embrace challenges, persist in the face of setbacks, see failure as
    essential to mastery, learn from criticism, and find lessons and inspiration
    in the success of others".

I stole that. That's a quote. I took it from my company's self-assessment page.
This is the tool that I use twice a year to evaluate the progress that I have
made as a software developer at Microsoft. It is the standard that managers at
Microsoft use when deciding which of their direct reports are ready to be
promoted. And it is what guides our interviewers when selecting candidates
for new hires and internships.

Let's break this down and take a deeper look at each of the core components of
that quote.

## A Desire to Learn

## A Tendency to Embrace Challenges

## Persistence in the Face of Setbacks

## Failing your way to Mastery

## Learning from Criticism

## Finding Lessons and Inspiration in the Success of Others

## Conclusion

Being good at stuff is important for finding a job. If you want to find a job as
a software developer, you'll obviously need to know at least a little bit about
how to develop software. But being good at stuff is *really* hard. Becoming an
expert in a given topic takes a lot of time and experience. And when I say "a
lot of time and experience", I don't mean "4 years of college and an internship
or two". The goal of university is to provide you with a very broad pool of
knowledge. It's practically impossible for you, a student, to be a perfect,
rock-star expert candidate when applying for jobs.

But there's good news; you don't have to be. Your potential employers are fully
aware that you are not an expert. Sure, they'll expect you to have some
background in software, but generally, when companies hire students, they
understand that they are hiring someone who will need mentorship and training.
When a company brings on new hires and interns straight out of university, they
are not looking for someone who is already an expert, but rather someone who
demonstrates the ability to learn and grow and *become* an expert.

They want to see that you are eager to learn. They want developers who seek out
challenges and are willing to take risks. They expect that you will make
mistakes and occasionally struggle. They already know that you are probably not
going to get things right the first time; they know that you are going to
sometimes fail. But they also hope that you will learn from those failures. They
hope that you will accept feedback and criticism and use it to improve. And
finally, they want to see that you work well with others, that you are learning
from the successes and failures of your peers.
