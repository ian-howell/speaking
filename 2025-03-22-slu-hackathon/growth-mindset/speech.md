# Growth Mindset

## Introduction

Hey everyone. My name is Ian Howell and I'm a software engineer working for
Microsoft. I have 8 years of experience in the industry, working on both
proprietary software as well as open source projects, and recently have been
working to help build up our technical community in St. Louis, through various
meetups such as Code & Coffee and StlGo.

Before I get started with the talk, I would just like to extend a thank you to
everyone here who is involved with HackSLU; the organizers, the mentors, the
judges, the speakers, and of course, those of you who are participating.

Today I'm going to spend some time talking about the Growth Mindset, and how it
can help you to break into the software development industry.

## A Growth Mindset

So what am I talking about? What is this "Growth Mindset" thing?

A person with a growth mindset believes that they are able to change themselves,
that they are a dynamic being. They know that they can improve their skills and
adapt to new situations, and that learning requires effort and practice.

    A growth mindset leads to a desire to learn and therefore a tendency to
    embrace challenges, persist in the face of setbacks, see failure as
    essential to mastery, learn from criticism, and find lessons and inspiration
    in the success of others.

I stole that. That's a quote. It originally came out of a book, but I know it
best from my company's self-assessment page. This is what I reference twice a
year to evaluate myself as an employee at Microsoft. It's what I use to judge
the progress that I have made as a software developer. It's also what my
managers use, not only for themselves, but also as a guideline for how they
determine which of their direct reports are exceeding expectations, who they are
going to promote, and who's going to be getting a really big bonus. These are
also the qualities that interviewers are looking for when deciding who to bring
on as a new hire or intern.

So it's really important to me. And it's really important to my company. And
honestly, it's probably pretty important to all of the companies that you want
to work for. So it should be really important to you too. A growth mindset will
help you to excel in all aspects of your life. It can help you become a better
developer, a better student, a better friend. Now, we're going to talk about
using it to break into the software development industry. But I promise that if
you start employing this way of thinking, it will change your life. It changed
mine.

If you missed the quote, that's okay, we're going to break it down and discuss
each of the qualities, starting with:

## A Desire to Learn

A Growth Mindset leads to a desire to learn.

(intro pause)

About a year and a half ago, my team brought on a new Principal. For those who
don't know, a Principal is a step above Senior. So you would expect these guys
to know their stuff, to be experts in software, and to have answers to every
question. But this guy *didn't* have all the answers. In fact, he made it *very*
clear that he didn't have all the answers. I would hop on a call with him, and
it wouldn't matter if it was a one on one, a stand up with 10 or so people, or
an organization-wide meeting with more than 100 people on the call, this guy had
questions. And you would expect that these would be hard, technical questions.
The kinds of questions that a Principal would be expected to know the answer to.
But They weren't. They were **fundamental** questions, really *basic* questions.
Questions that every single person on the call should know the answer to. Quite
frankly, they were questions that I would have been embarrassed ask.

(brief pause)

But I started to notice something strange. Sometimes, he would ask a question,
and I would immediately get that gut feeling that this was really basic, that he
should really know this. But then I would notice something really humbling; I
sometimes didn't know the answer to the question either. I was learning just by
being in the same room as him. The whole team was learning and growing alongside
him.

(brief pause)

And this principal *excelled*. He uncovered problems that had existed on our
team since it was *formed*. He completely revamped our developer environments
into something that is much more user-friendly and easy to use. He refactored
large chunks of some of the most confusing code in our codebase. And ultimately,
he wound up fulfilling the role of a Principal, leading the way on large complex
features, from design to helping the rest of the team implement it.

In just a few months, this person went from being a "question asker" to being a
"question answerer". And he was able to do it because he had a *genuine
curiosity*.

(super brief pause)

He had a "Desire to Learn".

## A Tendency to Embrace Challenges

You guys. What are we all doing here today?

We're at a hackathon. We are *already* embracing challenges. And I assure you,
this *is* going to be challenging. Hackathons are hard. You're going to need to
work with unfamiliar technologies. You're going to need to work with people you
don't know. You're probably going to be up late tonight, and you're going to be
exhausted by the end of it. And tomorrow, you may end up needing to present your
idea, and the progress you made on it.

## Persistence in the Face of Setbacks and Failing your way to Mastery

An individual with a growth mindset "Persists in the Face of Setbacks", and
recognizes that "Failure is Essential to Mastery".

(intro pause)

Has anyone here ever heard of the "10,000 Hour Rule"?

The "10,000 Hour Rule" is a theory that it takes 10,000 hours of practice to
become an expert in a given skill.

(somewhat pregnant pause)

Okay, has anyone here ever played Dark Souls?

Dark Souls is a video game that is notorious for being *hard*. The gameplay loop
involves running from the start point to the boss, at which point you will
likely take a beating, fail, and having to start all over. And you will fail. A
lot. Perhaps for hours, although hopefully fewer than 10,000 :D.

Dark Souls is honestly a really good example of failing your way to mastery. The
first time you enter a boss arena, you're probably gonna get squashed flat in a
matter of seconds. But in time, you'll begin to learn the patterns and timings.
You'll find that you're able to hang in there just a bit longer on each attempt,
and whittle down the health bar just a tiny bit more. And with some effort, it
will being to feel less and less like a beat-down, and more like a dance. The
motions will ingrain themselves into your muscle memory. You'll start playing on
autopilot, and eventually, you'll emerge victoriously, able to progress to the
next level.

Obviously, this idea can be applied to any skill. You can apply it to
programming. You can apply it to interviewing. You can apply it to public
speaking, kinda like I'm doing right now.

And here's the thing. If you're going to fail, you might as well do it in a safe
environment where you are able to learn from your mistakes. It's part of the
reason why community events like HackSLU are so important. It provides you with
a safe environment where you can take risks, you can experiment, and you can
fail, knowing that there is a safety net there to catch you.

So don't be afraid to fail. Embrace it. Learn from it. And when you do fail,
don't let it get you down. Use it as an opportunity to grow and improve. It's
important to remember that failure is not the end of the world. It's just a step
on the road to mastery.

## Learning from Criticism

## Finding Lessons and Inspiration in the Success of Others

## Conclusion

Being good at stuff is important for finding a job. If you want to find a job as
a software developer, you'll obviously need to know at least a little bit about
how to develop software. But being good at stuff is *really* hard. Becoming an
expert in a given topic takes a lot of time and experience. And when I say "a
lot of time and experience", I don't mean "4 years of college and an internship
or two". The goal of university is to provide you with a very broad pool of
knowledge. It's practically impossible for you, a student, to be a perfect,
rock-star expert candidate when applying for jobs.

But there's good news; you don't have to be. Your potential employers are fully
aware that you are not an expert. Sure, they'll expect you to have some
background in software, but generally, when companies hire students, they
understand that they are hiring someone who will need mentorship and training.
When a company brings on new hires and interns straight out of university, they
are not looking for someone who is already an expert, but rather someone who
demonstrates the ability to learn and grow and *become* an expert.

They want to see that you are eager to learn. They want developers who seek out
challenges and are willing to take risks. They expect that you will make
mistakes and occasionally struggle. They already know that you are probably not
going to get things right the first time; they know that you are going to
sometimes fail. But they also hope that you will learn from those failures. They
hope that you will accept feedback and criticism and use it to improve. And
finally, they want to see that you work well with others, that you are learning
from the successes and failures of your peers.
